// ZapierKeyPermissions is the grant a Zapier connection's API key is minted with, verb by verb:
//
//   - transactional read and write: sending is what the integration is for. Write performs the
//     send; read backs the notification picker, and without it that required field answers 403
//     and the step cannot be saved at all.
//   - webhook_subscriptions read and write: every trigger registers and removes its own REST
//     hook when the Zap is turned on and off.
//   - contacts read and write: the contact actions upsert contacts, every trigger reads contacts
//     for the sample data Zapier shows while a Zap is being built, and a send upserts its
//     recipient.
//   - lists read and write: the list picker and the subscribe action.
//   - segments read only: the segment picker, and the member lookup behind both segment
//     triggers. Read is the whole of it — nothing in the app writes a segment — and the two
//     segment triggers are unusable without it.
//
// transactional:write is wider than "may send a configured notification", and the trade was
// made deliberately. The same verb gates transactional.create/.update/.delete,
// transactional.testTemplate, email.testProvider, and the SMTP bridge — which seeds an identity
// so SendNotification runs this very check. So a leaked Zapier token can relay arbitrary mail
// through the workspace's provider credentials over both HTTP and SMTP, and can delete
// transactional notifications. There is no finer grain to grant: sending is the integration's
// purpose, and this verb is the only key to it. Message history stays unreadable.
//
// This is the key's *initial* grant, not an invariant: /api/workspaces.setUserPermissions is a
// live endpoint and Settings → Team edits the row freely, so an owner may widen or narrow the
// key afterwards and nothing here reasserts it.
//
// It returns a fresh map on every call for the reason NewFullPermissions carries: a shared
// package-level map has been mutated by a caller once already.
