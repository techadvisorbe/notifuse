          Connecting Zapier lets a Zap send your transactional notifications —
          an order confirmation, a password reset — using your templates and
          your email provider. A Zap can also react to Notifuse events, such as
          a new contact, a list subscription or a segment a contact joined, and
          create or update contacts and subscribe them to your lists. Each Zap
          you turn on registers its own webhook subscription, which you can see
          in Settings → Webhooks.
