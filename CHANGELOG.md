# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [34.1] - 2026-06-25

- **Fix**: Workspace SMTP integrations now connect to servers that advertise only `AUTH LOGIN` (such as Azure Communication Services) — the raw SMTP sender hardcoded `AUTH PLAIN` and was rejected with a 504 before credentials were ever checked. It now reads the AUTH mechanisms advertised in EHLO and uses LOGIN when PLAIN isn't offered, preferring PLAIN when both are available (#368).
- **Fix**: Unsubscribing from the notification center works again. The widget's "Unsubscribe" action and per-list toggle (and the console) now post to a dedicated `/unsubscribe` endpoint, while `/unsubscribe-oneclick` is reserved for the RFC 8058 mail-client one-click carried in the `List-Unsubscribe` header (it still accepts the legacy JSON body as a backward-compatible shim). When v34.0 made `/unsubscribe-oneclick` strictly RFC 8058 for the Gmail/Yahoo one-click fix, the notification center's JSON request was rejected with `400 "Invalid request"` and contacts stayed subscribed (#371).
- **Fix**: A freshly installed root account no longer crashes the console on first login. Before any workspace existed, `user.me` returned `"workspaces": null` instead of `[]` for the `ROOT_EMAIL` user — the root path returns the workspace list straight from the database, which is a nil slice when empty — and the console crashed with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'length')` instead of redirecting to workspace creation. The repository now returns an empty (non-nil) slice so the API always serializes `[]`, and the console normalizes a null `workspaces` to an empty array as a safeguard (#367).
- **Fix**: An `mj-button` (or `mj-social`) whose inner padding was edited in the visual editor no longer vanishes in Gmail — the inner-padding object was compiled into the CSS as a Go map literal (`padding:map[bottom:0px top:0px]`) that strict clients reject; it now compiles to a valid CSS shorthand, and the editor no longer stores padding as an object (#369).

## [34.0] - 2026-06-20

- **Feature**: Single Sign-On via OpenID Connect (OIDC) alongside magic-code login — off by default and enabled per deployment with `OIDC_*` env vars, the setup wizard, or Settings → SSO (client secret encrypted at rest), so the sign-in page shows an SSO button only when it is turned on. Invited-users-only by default with opt-in just-in-time provisioning gated by a verified-email domain allowlist; identities are keyed on the durable issuer+subject pair (never email alone) and login still requires a workspace invite or `ROOT_EMAIL` for access. Uses Authorization Code + PKCE and works with any compliant provider (Google Workspace, Keycloak, Okta, …); adds the `federated_identities` system table (migration v34).
- **Fix**: One-click unsubscribe (RFC 8058) now works end-to-end. The `/unsubscribe-oneclick` endpoint takes its parameters from the `List-Unsubscribe` URL query string — it previously tried to JSON-decode the POST body and rejected every mail-client request with `400 "Invalid request body"`. The emitted URL now also carries the `email_hmac` the endpoint verifies. And the endpoint no longer applies User-Agent bot detection, which silently dropped the automated POSTs that Gmail/Yahoo/Apple (and tools like `curl`) actually send (returning `200` while leaving the contact subscribed); it instead requires the RFC 8058 `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` body token to deflect bare prefetch/scanner POSTs (#362).
- **Feature**: Google Gemini is now a selectable LLM provider for the AI agent (blog & email generation), alongside Anthropic and OpenAI — configure it under Settings → Integrations with a Gemini API key and model (default Gemini 3.1 Pro); when multiple LLM integrations are configured, a provider dropdown in the AI chat selects which to use.
- **Feature**: Search broadcasts by name and filter by status on the broadcasts list — a grouped status filter (All/Draft/Scheduled/Sending/Sent/Failed) plus a debounced name search beside it, both persisted in the URL; the `broadcasts.list` API now accepts multiple statuses and a name search (#335).

## [33.0] - 2026-06-16

### Database Schema Changes

- Migration v33.0 (workspace): adds `message_history.smtp_message_id` (with a partial index) for reply matching, `automations.exit_on_reply`, a partial unique index on `inbound_webhook_events` to dedup replayed replies, and redefines the `track_inbound_webhook_event_changes()` trigger so inbound events of type `reply`/`auto_reply` surface on the contact timeline as `email.replied`/`email.auto_reply`. Column adds are nullable/constant-default (instant, no table rewrite).

### Features

- **Feature**: Stop-on-reply for automations (#346). When a contact replies to a sequence email, the journey stops. Replies are ingested via a new public endpoint `POST /webhooks/email/inbound?workspace_id={id}&integration_id={id}` (Mailgun first; provider-agnostic parser registry for the rest). For Mailgun, the inbound Route that forwards replies to this endpoint is now created automatically by the same **Register Webhooks** action used for delivery/bounce webhooks (only the DNS MX records remain a manual step); the route is non-preemptive (no `stop()`, lower priority) so it never silently overrides other inbound consumers on a shared Mailgun domain. The public endpoint is rate-limited per source IP and per workspace, and permanent client errors return 4xx (not 5xx) so providers don't retry-loop. Inbound mail is classified so bounces and out-of-office auto-replies never count as a reply. A genuine reply is matched to the send strictly by `In-Reply-To`/`References` → the `Message-ID` stored at send time (persisted before the email is dispatched so even an instant reply matches), which both identifies the contact and scopes the exit to the exact automation that sent the replied-to email; replies that don't match a stored send are ignored, and a replayed/duplicate reply is deduplicated so it can't re-exit a re-enrolled journey. The matched reply is recorded on the contact timeline as `email.replied` and — when the automation has **Exit on reply** enabled — exits the contact's journey (bounded to journeys entered before the reply). The stop is enforced by a layered guarantee (event-driven interrupt + an active-guarded optimistic lock on the executor's happy *and* error paths + a just-in-time guard in the email queue worker) so it holds whether the contact is mid-delay or the next email is already queued, and a concurrent exit is never resurrected by a retry. The feature is free for workspaces that don't enable it (no extra per-send queries or index maintenance).
- **Feature**: Stop-on-reply also supports **Amazon SES** — inbound replies arrive as RSA-signature-verified, topic-bound Amazon SNS notifications; **Register Webhooks** auto-provisions the SNS topic + a coexistence-safe SES receipt rule (scoped to verified identities, region-validated), and the Message-ID SES returns at send is captured and matched host-independently (#346).
- **Feature**: `ROOT_EMAIL` now accepts multiple comma/semicolon-separated emails, so a shared self-hosted instance can have more than one root administrator without displacing the first. Root-gated actions (workspace creation, system settings, root HMAC sign-in) now check list membership instead of a single equality, and a user row is created on startup for every listed root so each can sign in immediately. Matching is case-sensitive and a single email behaves exactly as before. The console System Settings drawer edits the list as tags; the setup wizard still establishes the primary (first) root. Example: `ROOT_EMAIL=alice@example.com,bob@example.com` (#361).

### Fixes

- **Fix**: Translated email templates now send with their own inbox preview text (preheader) instead of the default language's. The inbox preview is rendered from the `mj-preview` block embedded in the email tree, but the metadata-sync that stamps it from the `subject_preview` field only ran for the default template — never for translations — so a translation kept the preview value it was cloned with, even after its preview was edited and saved. The sync now stamps every language variant, and all send paths (broadcast, automation, transactional) additionally inject each resolved variant's `subject_preview` at compile time, which also corrects already-saved translations without a re-save (#359).

## [32.3] - 2026-06-01

- **Security**: Broadcast data-feed endpoints (`broadcasts.refreshGlobalFeed`, `broadcasts.testRecipientFeed`) are no longer a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vector and now require `broadcasts:write`. The data-feed fetcher used a plain HTTP client with no address validation, so any authenticated workspace member — including a read-only member — could make the server fetch an arbitrary URL (internal services, the private network, or the cloud instance metadata endpoint) and read back the JSON response. The fetcher now uses the SSRF-safe client already used for favicon detection (dial-time rejection of private/loopback/link-local/reserved ranges, redirect re-validation, DNS-rebinding protection), and both service methods enforce the same write permission as broadcast creation. Trusted self-hosted deployments that intentionally fetch feeds from their internal network can opt out with `BROADCAST_DATA_FEED_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true`.
- **Security**: All broadcast operations now enforce workspace permissions. Previously only create/get/refresh/test were permission-checked, so any workspace member — including a read-only member — could update, delete, schedule, pause, resume, cancel, send, and select A/B winners for broadcasts. Mutating operations now require `broadcasts:write` and listing/test-results require `broadcasts:read`; unauthorized requests receive `403 Forbidden`.
- **Fix**: The task scheduler now executes due tasks in-process when the internal scheduler is enabled (`TASK_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`), instead of dispatching them over HTTP to its own `/api/tasks.execute` endpoint. In single-instance deployments where the app cannot reach its own public URL (e.g. a pod that is itself the load balancer's backend), the self-call failed with `connection refused` and left `send_broadcast` and other tasks stuck `pending`; HTTP fan-out is still used when the scheduler is disabled (external cron).
- **Fix**: Selecting a different email node in the automation editor now refreshes the config panel — the shared template selector (`TemplateSelectorInput`) cached the first template it resolved and ignored later changes to its controlled `value`, so switching between email nodes kept showing (and appearing to edit) the first node's template (#353).
- **Fix**: Test emails sent from the template editor now honor the template's Reply-To — the `transactional.testTemplate` path built the message from the modal's options only and never fell back to the template's `reply_to`, so test emails arrived without a `Reply-To` header (real automation/broadcast/transactional sends were already unaffected); an explicit Reply-To from the modal's Advanced options still takes precedence (#355).
- **Fix**: Workspace members with the `workspace` write permission ("full access") can now manage contact custom field labels. Previously both the Settings → Custom Fields controls and the underlying save were gated to workspace **owners** only, so full-access members had no way to add or edit field labels (#354). Custom field labels are now managed via a dedicated, permission-checked endpoint `POST /api/workspaces.setCustomFieldLabels` (granular `workspace:write` instead of owner role), mirroring the template-blocks pattern. As a side effect, `workspaces.update` no longer writes custom field labels — so an owner saving general settings can no longer clobber labels set by a member.
- **Fix**: Workspace members with the `blog` write permission can now manage blog settings — enabling the blog and editing its title, SEO, pagination, and feed configuration. Previously both the Settings → Blog editor and the underlying save were gated to workspace **owners** only, so a delegated "blog manager" granted `blog:write` could publish posts and themes but could not enable the blog or change its settings. Blog settings are now managed via a dedicated, permission-checked endpoint `POST /api/workspaces.setBlogSettings` (granular `blog:write` instead of owner role), mirroring the custom-field-labels pattern. As a side effect, `workspaces.update` no longer writes blog settings — so an owner saving general settings can no longer clobber blog config set by a member.
- **Fix**: Broadcasts to a double opt-in list no longer reach contacts who never confirmed — recipients whose `contact_list` status is `pending` are now excluded from both the recipient count and the send (#344).
- **Fix**: Typing into a button's text editor in the email builder no longer puts each character on its own line — StarterKit's `TrailingNode` was enabled in the button's paragraph-less inline schema, where it falls back to `hardBreak` and appended a `<br>` after every keystroke; it is now disabled for the inline editor (#352).
- **Improvement**: `{{ workspace.base_url }}` / `{{ workspace.website_url }}` now render in the template preview — the `/api/templates.compile` endpoint injects the workspace object server-side (filling only missing keys, so historical message snapshots are preserved), so any API consumer gets it, not just the console, and the Preview tab no longer renders `website_url` as empty (#342).
- **Refactor**: Extracted shared `WorkspaceSettings.ResolveEndpoint` and `BuildWorkspaceTemplateVars` helpers, replacing ~8 duplicated copies of the tracking-endpoint resolution and `workspace` template-object construction across the send and preview paths.

## [32.2] - 2026-05-31

- **Feature**: Exposed `{{ workspace.website_url }}` in email templates — the workspace's public Website URL (trailing slash trimmed), distinct from `{{ workspace.base_url }}` (the tracking endpoint) — so templates can compose application links like `{{ workspace.website_url }}/users/verify/xxx` instead of pointing at the tracking domain (#342).

## [32.1] - 2026-05-29

- **Feature**: Exposed `{{ workspace.base_url }}` in email templates — the resolved Custom Endpoint URL (or the default API endpoint), trailing slash trimmed — so templates can compose links from relative paths like `{{ workspace.base_url }}/users/verify/xxx` (#342).
- **Security**: Bumped `liquidjs` to 10.27.0 in console to clear 6 Dependabot alerts (critical RCE, ReDoS in `strip_html`, `date` filter padding DoS, `{% render %}` `ownPropertyOnly` bypass, empty `{% for %}` renderLimit bypass, and `strip_html` newline XSS); `npm audit fix` also cleared transitive `brace-expansion` and `ws` advisories.
- **Fix**: Mailgun webhook registration no longer fails with `400` on domains shared with other services — Notifuse now merges its callback URL into each event's existing URL set via `PUT` (up to Mailgun's limit of 3 per event) instead of always `POST`ing, and unregistering removes only its own URL while preserving other consumers' (#340).

## [32.0] - 2026-05-22

### Database Schema Changes

- Migration v32.0 adds a `language` column (`VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en'`) to the system `users` table. Existing users default to English.

### Features

- **Feature**: System emails and the console UI are now localized per user. Each user has a `language` preference — one of `en`, `fr`, `es`, `de`, `ca`, `pt-BR`, `ja`, `it` — that drives both their console UI locale and the language of the system emails (authentication code, workspace invitation, broadcast circuit-breaker alert) sent to them. The language is changed from the console language switcher and persisted via the new `POST /api/user.updateLanguage` endpoint. Magic-code emails use the recipient's language, circuit-breaker alerts use each owner's language, and workspace invitations use the inviter's language.

## [31.0] - 2026-05-19

### Database Schema Changes

- Migration v31.0 updates the `queue_contact_for_segment_recomputation` trigger function on every workspace database to short-circuit when the inserted `contact_timeline` row is itself a segment membership event (`kind IN ('segment.joined', 'segment.left')`).

### Fixes

- **Fix**: `queue_contact_for_segment_recomputation` trigger no longer re-enqueues contacts when the inserted `contact_timeline` event is itself a segment membership change (`segment.joined`/`segment.left`). Removes a self-loop where every membership write re-queued the same contact.
- **Fix**: Recurring tasks dispatched via HTTP now write `timeout_after` in UTC. The column is `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` and the scheduler compares it against `time.Now().UTC()`; on non-UTC hosts the local-time value caused the task to appear "still running" for the host's UTC offset. Same fix applied to the broadcast-pause `next_run_after`.
- **Fix**: `GetWorkspaceConnection`'s pool health check now uses an isolated context for `pool.PingContext` instead of the caller's. A caller-context cancellation no longer triggers pool eviction.

## [30.3] - 2026-05-14

- **Fix**: UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_term`) were dropped from tracked links when click tracking was enabled — the encrypted `/r/` redirect token embedded the raw destination URL instead of the UTM-augmented one. The UTM parameters are now preserved in the redirect target.

## [30.2] - 2026-05-13

- **Fix**: SES `4.4.7 Message expired` (retry-exhaustion) now suppresses on the first event, and any recipient that accumulates 5 consecutive soft bounces with no successful delivery in between is also suppressed; `MessageTooLarge`/`ContentRejected`/`AttachmentRejected` never count (#323).
- **Fix**: Email AI Assistant `setEmailTree` tool now declares `items` on its `children` array schema, so OpenAI-compatible providers no longer reject the request with `array schema missing items` (#324). Anthropic was already lenient about this; only OpenAI-compatible endpoints surfaced the error.
- **Improvement**: `/api/templates.compile` now accepts and returns `subject` and `subject_preview`, rendered through the same Liquid engine used at send time. Previously the API only returned `mjml`/`html`, so the console preview drawer rendered the subject in-browser with `liquidjs`, which could diverge from the Go-side `liquidgo` output used by the send pipeline. Any API consumer can now retrieve the rendered subject directly (#329).
- **Deps**: Bumped `liquidjs` to 10.25.7, `postcss` to 8.5.14, `fast-xml-parser` override to ≥5.8.0 (+ new `fast-xml-builder` ≥1.1.7 override), and `github.com/prometheus/prometheus` to v0.311.3.

## [30.1] - 2026-04-27

- **Security**: Bumped `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` to v1.41.0 in `telemetry/go.mod` (CVE-2026-29181).
- **Deps**: Bumped `gomjml` to v0.12.0.

### Breaking Changes

- **SMTP auth with `SMTP_USE_TLS=false`**: When TLS is explicitly disabled, the SMTP client now uses `PLAIN-NOENC` (go-mail's `SMTPAuthPlainNoEnc`) explicitly instead of `SMTPAuthAutoDiscover`. Previously, go-mail's auto-discover refused `PLAIN`/`LOGIN` over an unencrypted connection (only `SCRAM-SHA-*` and `CRAM-MD5` were tried), and `SMTPAuthPlain` itself also refused unencrypted connections at the AUTH step. `PLAIN-NOENC` bypasses both gates while sending the standard `AUTH PLAIN` command on the wire, so any server that advertises `AUTH PLAIN` (e.g. local maddy/Mailpit relays) accepts it. Operators who have set `SMTP_USE_TLS=false` have already accepted plaintext credential transit, so forcing `PLAIN` aligns with their stated intent. **Action**: none if your relay accepts `PLAIN`. If your relay only accepts `SCRAM`/`CRAM-MD5`, you must enable TLS (`SMTP_USE_TLS=true`) — auto-discover continues to apply when TLS is on.

## [30.0] - 2026-04-23

### Breaking Changes

- **Webhooks**: Signatures now conform to the [Standard Webhooks](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/blob/main/spec/standard-webhooks.md) specification and match the published verification code in the docs (#318)
  - Stored secrets are now prefixed with `whsec_` and the 32 random bytes after the prefix are base64-decoded before use as the HMAC key (previously the 44-char base64 string was used directly as raw bytes, making the published Python/JS/Go/PHP verification snippets always fail)
  - V30 migration rotates every existing webhook secret to the new format. Subscriptions, URLs, event filters, enabled state, and delivery history are preserved; only the secret value changes
  - **Consumer action required**: copy the new `whsec_…` secret from the console into your environment and update your verification code to the spec-compliant form shown in the docs. Deliveries that fire during the gap will retry automatically once the consumer's secret is updated

### Data migration

- **Timezone**: `Europe/Kiev` is rewritten to the IANA-canonical `Europe/Kyiv` across `workspaces.settings`, `contacts.timezone`, `segments.timezone`, and `broadcasts.schedule.timezone`. Stored `Europe/Kiev` continued to resolve at runtime via Go's tzdata alias, but the console dropdown (which no longer lists the obsolete name) showed an empty selection for affected rows. The `contacts` triggers are briefly disabled around the rename so it does not emit `contact.updated` webhook events or fill `contact_timeline` with rename entries.

### Other changes

- **Task dispatch no longer swallowed by auth proxies (#320, #317)**: The scheduler's internal `POST /api/tasks.execute` client now refuses to follow redirects (`CheckRedirect = http.ErrUseLastResponse`). Previously, an auth-walling reverse proxy (Cloudflare Access, Authelia, oauth2-proxy, Traefik Forward Auth, etc.) sitting in front of the API could respond with a 302 to its login page; Go's default `http.Client` followed the redirect as a GET, the login page returned 200 OK HTML, and the dispatcher logged "dispatched successfully" while the task never ran. The 302 is now surfaced in the non-200 branch (with the `Location` header logged) so the misconfiguration is loud instead of silent. **Operator note**: if your ingress performs an HTTP→HTTPS redirect on the API path, set `$API_ENDPOINT` to the final HTTPS URL — the dispatch client will no longer silently upgrade it.
- **Task scheduler**: Scheduler tick no longer waits on in-flight HTTP dispatches, so one slow recurring task can't delay dispatch of others on the same tick. Stale tasks left in `running` with an expired `timeout_after` are now reclaimed by `MarkAsRunningTx` on a subsequent tick instead of looping on 409 indefinitely (#317).
- **Task dispatch observability**: The scheduler-side "Task execution request dispatched successfully" log now includes the HTTP `status_code`, and `tasks.execute` logs an entry line on the handler side. Diffing the two streams makes any remaining silent-interception failure mode visible.
- **Feature**: Added AWS region `eu-central-2` (Europe, Zurich) to the S3 provider and integrations region selectors (#316).

## [29.5] - 2026-04-20

- **Feature**: Pause, resume, and cancel broadcasts mid-delivery — even after the orchestrator has finished enqueueing — and cancel is now allowed from the Processing state (#303)
- **Contacts**: Added in-table bulk actions (multi-select delete, add to list, remove from list, unsubscribe) with progress modal and "Skipped" tagging for no-op cases (#299)

## [29.4] - 2026-04-15

- **Feature**: Added `SMTP_BRIDGE_TLS` setting (`off` / `starttls` / `implicit`) to let operators run the SMTP bridge behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or in implicit-TLS (SMTPS) mode (#314)
- **Feature**: Blog RSS 2.0 and JSON Feed 1.1 syndication — automatic `/feed.xml` and `/feed.json` endpoints per workspace, per-category feeds, conditional GET with ETag, gzip, XSS-sanitized content, autodiscovery `<link>` tags, and admin-configurable feed settings
- **i18n**: Notification center confirmation banner (subscribe/unsubscribe result) is now translated in all supported languages instead of always showing English (#315)
- **Security**: Bumped transitive `github.com/prometheus/prometheus` from v0.35.0 to v0.311.2 to clear Dependabot alert for CVE-2026-40179 (stored XSS in Prometheus web UI; Notifuse only imports `model/value`, so it was not exploitable)

## [29.3] - 2026-04-12

- **Fix**: Double opt-in confirmation link now correctly transitions contacts from Pending to Active instead of resending the confirmation email in a loop (#313)

## [29.2] - 2026-04-08

- **Feature**: Added OpenAI as LLM provider alongside Anthropic — supports any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, Azure, etc.) via custom base URL, with full streaming and tool use support
- **Security**: Updated liquidjs to 10.25.5 in console and vitest to 3.2.4 in notification center to fix 5 Dependabot vulnerabilities
- **Deps**: Updated @vitejs/plugin-react to 5.2.0 in console and notification center
- **Feature**: Added System Settings drawer for root admin to view and edit system configuration from the dashboard
- **Workspace**: Enforce workspace creation limits via `MAX_WORKSPACES` env var (0 = unlimited), with "upgrade your plan" messaging in the console
- **Improvement**: Email open tracking now works independently of click tracking — added Cache-Control headers to prevent proxy caching, encrypted tracking URLs (`/t/`, `/r/`) to avoid pixel blocker detection, and padded tracking pixel (#307)
- **i18n**: Added Polish language support to the notification center

## [29.1] - 2026-04-07

- **Security**: Upgraded Vite to 7.3.2 in console and notification center to fix arbitrary file read via WebSocket (CVE-2026-39363)
- **Fix**: Removed invalid `visibility` attribute from MJML section output that caused template compilation errors (#305)
- **Fix**: Automation now exits when contact is unsubscribed/bounced/complained for marketing emails, while still allowing transactional emails to be sent (#304)
- **Fix**: Social media buttons now link directly to pages by default instead of wrapping URLs in share prompts; added "Share link" toggle to social element settings (#306)

## [29.0] - 2026-04-04

### Breaking Changes

- **Rename**: "SMTP Relay" renamed to "SMTP Bridge" throughout the application
  - Environment variables: `SMTP_RELAY_*` renamed to `SMTP_BRIDGE_*` (old names still accepted for backward compatibility)
  - Database settings keys migrated automatically via V29 migration
  - JSON API: `smtp_relay_*` fields renamed to `smtp_bridge_*` in setup endpoints
  - Frontend routes: `/settings/smtp-relay` changed to `/settings/smtp-bridge`

- **Security**: Upgraded happy-dom to 20.8.9 in notification center and picomatch to 4.0.4 in console
- **Improvement**: SMTP EHLO hostname now defaults to the from-email domain instead of the SMTP host, improving compatibility with strict providers (#301)
- **Security**: Updated lodash/lodash-es to 4.18.x, brace-expansion to 5.0.5, and yaml to 2.8.3 to fix prototype pollution, code injection, ReDoS, and stack overflow vulnerabilities

## [28.4] - 2026-03-27

- **Security**: Upgraded picomatch to 4.0.4 in notification center
- **Contacts**: Fixed dropdown menu becoming unresponsive after deleting contacts, and pagination state now persists in URL across page refreshes (#294)
- **Templates**: Test emails now load the full contact record, so Liquid variables like `{{ contact.first_name }}` render correctly

## [28.3] - 2026-03-20

- **Broadcasts**: Fixed MJML code mode templates failing with "template missing content" error when sending broadcasts
- **Contacts**: Fixed `/api/contacts.list` rejecting partial email searches with "invalid email format" error. The `email` filter now accepts partial strings for substring matching as intended (#292)

## [28.1] - 2026-03-09

- **Transactional Emails**: Added `subject_preview` override to `email_options`, allowing dynamic email preheader text per API call with Liquid templating support
- **Templates**: Added language selection to "Send Test Email" modal and "Preview Template" drawer, allowing users to preview and test translated email variants
- **Demo**: Demo workspace now includes French and Spanish translations for all 4 email templates, showcasing the multi-language feature
- **Templates**: Downloaded template files now use the template's name as filename instead of a generic name (#286)
- **Email Builder**: Added `mj-liquid` block type for embedding raw MJML+Liquid code in the visual editor, enabling dynamic structural content like for-loops generating columns or conditional sections
- **Security**: Upgraded liquidjs to 10.25.0

## [28.0] - 2026-03-05

- **Templates**: Added option to choose between visual email builder or MJML code editor when creating templates
- **Templates**: Added ability to translate email templates to languages configured in workspace settings
- **Contacts**: Fixed invalid "Blacklisted" status option in change status dropdown, replaced with valid "Bounced" and "Complained" statuses (#285)
- **SMTP**: Added configurable EHLO hostname for SMTP connections. Some SMTP servers reject `EHLO localhost`; users can now set a custom hostname (e.g., their domain) via the `SMTP_EHLO_HOSTNAME` env var, setup wizard, or workspace integration settings. Defaults to the SMTP host value when empty.
- **Transactional Notifications**: Fixed delivery stats (sent, delivered, failed, bounced) always showing 0 by linking messages to their originating notification via a new `transactional_notification_id` column
- **Email Builder**: Fixed `<mj-attributes>` global styles not applying in preview and sent emails (#282)

## [27.4] - 2026-03-01

- **Notification Center**: Fixed browser language auto-save overwriting contact's manually chosen language. Now only auto-detects when contact has no language set.
- **Email Builder**: Fixed missing MJML component defaults (border-radius, borders, background, direction, textAlign) causing styles not to render in the WYSIWYG editor
- **Transactional Emails**: Added `subject` override to `email_options`, allowing dynamic email subject lines per API call with Liquid templating support (#281)

## [27.3] - 2026-02-28

- **Segments**: Added template filter to email activity conditions, allowing segments like "opened template X at least 3 times"
- **SMTP**: Fixed TLS override option not working for system emails (magic codes, invitations, alerts). The "Use TLS" toggle was ignored, causing certificate errors on local SMTP relays (#275)
- **Automations**: Fixed automation emails rendering `{{ notification_center_url }}` and `{{ unsubscribe_url }}` as empty strings by using the shared template data builder (#279)
- **Segments**: Fixed race condition where background task execution could pick up unrelated tasks, causing flaky segment recompute behavior
- **Security**: Upgraded rollup to 4.59.0 and minimatch to 10.2.4

## [23.0] - 2026-01-09

### Bug Fixes

- **Automation Triggers Not Firing**: Fixed critical bug where automations with "List / Subscribed" trigger never fired for workspaces created after v18 (#190)
  - Root cause: `init.go` had outdated trigger functions producing generic event kinds (`insert_contact_list`) instead of semantic event kinds (`list.subscribed`)
  - New workspaces only got `InitializeWorkspaceDatabase()` without running migrations, so they never received the v18 trigger updates
  - V23 migration reinstalls correct trigger functions on ALL existing workspaces
  - Updated `init.go` to use semantic event kinds for new workspaces
  - Fixed e2e test that was masking the bug by manually inserting timeline events

### Database Schema Changes

- Migration v23.0 reinstalls three PostgreSQL trigger functions with semantic event naming:
  - `track_contact_list_changes()`: `insert_contact_list` → `list.subscribed`, `list.confirmed`, etc.
  - `track_contact_segment_changes()`: `join_segment` → `segment.joined`, `leave_segment` → `segment.left`
  - `track_contact_changes()`: `insert_contact` → `contact.created`, `update_contact` → `contact.updated`

## [22.6] - 2026-01-06

### Bug Fixes

- **Segment Date Filters**: Fixed date picker sending dates in wrong format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` instead of ISO8601). Frontend now sends proper RFC3339 format for all segment date filters including contact fields, timeline timeframes, and custom events goal timeframes (fixes #182)

## [22.4] - 2026-01-06

### Bug Fixes

## [15.0] - 2025-11-01

### 🔒 SECURITY UPGRADE: PASETO → JWT + Enhanced Authentication Security

This is a **major security release** that migrates the authentication system from PASETO to JWT (HS256) and implements comprehensive security improvements.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

**Migration Requirements:**

- **REQUIRED**: Set `SECRET_KEY` environment variable before upgrading
  - **CRITICAL FOR EXISTING DEPLOYMENTS**:
    - If you already have `SECRET_KEY` set: **Keep it unchanged** (do not generate a new one)
    - If migrating from PASETO: Use your existing PASETO key: `export SECRET_KEY="$PASETO_PRIVATE_KEY"`
  - **For new installations only**: Generate new key: `export SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)`
- Server will automatically restart after migration to reload JWT configuration

**🚨 CRITICAL WARNING**:

- **DO NOT change your existing SECRET_KEY** - it encrypts all workspace integration secrets (email provider API keys, SMTP passwords, etc.)
- Changing SECRET_KEY will:
  - ❌ Make all encrypted integration secrets unreadable (permanent data loss)
  - ❌ Break all email sending (SparkPost, Mailjet, Mailgun, SMTP credentials lost)
  - ❌ Invalidate all JWT tokens and user sessions
- **Only generate a new SECRET_KEY for fresh installations with no existing data**

**What Gets Invalidated (During PASETO → JWT Migration):**

- ✗ All user sessions (users must log in again - PASETO tokens → JWT tokens)
- ✗ All API keys (must be regenerated - PASETO format → JWT format)
- ✗ All pending workspace invitations (invitation tokens were PASETO-signed)
- ✗ All active magic codes (migrating from plain-text → HMAC-SHA256 hashes)

**Why:** PASETO tokens are incompatible with JWT verification. Clean migration ensures no security gaps.

**Important Notes:**

- If you're already using JWT (not migrating from PASETO), and you keep your existing `SECRET_KEY`, your existing sessions remain valid.
- The `SECRET_KEY` is also used to encrypt workspace integration secrets (API keys, SMTP credentials). **Never change it on existing deployments** or you'll lose access to all encrypted credentials permanently.

### Security Improvements

#### 1. **JWT Authentication (HS256)**

- Migrated from PASETO to industry-standard JWT with HMAC-SHA256 signing
- **Simplified setup**: Uses symmetric key (`SECRET_KEY`) instead of PASETO's asymmetric key pair
  - No need to generate and manage separate public/private keys
  - Single `SECRET_KEY` environment variable for all cryptographic operations
  - Easier deployment and configuration management
- Algorithm confusion attack prevention (strict HMAC validation)
- Comprehensive token validation (signature, expiration, claims)
- Compatible with standard JWT libraries and tools

#### 2. **HMAC-Protected Magic Codes**

- Magic codes now stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes (no plain text in database)
- Database compromise cannot reveal authentication codes
- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks
- Migration clears all existing plain-text codes

#### 3. **Server-Side Logout**

- New `/api/user.logout` endpoint (POST, requires authentication)
- Deletes ALL sessions for the authenticated user from database
- Tokens become immediately invalid after logout
- Protected endpoints now verify session exists in database
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if session has been deleted
- Frontend integration with graceful error handling

#### 4. **Rate Limiting for Authentication Endpoints**

- Protection against brute force attacks and email bombing
- In-memory rate limiter with sliding window algorithm
- Sign-in endpoint: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per email address
- Verify code endpoint: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per email address
- Rate limiter automatically resets on successful authentication
- Thread-safe concurrent access with automatic cleanup
- Independent rate limits per user and per endpoint
- Prevents magic code brute force attacks (blocks 99%+ of attempts)

### Features

- Enhanced session verification in `GetCurrentUser` endpoint
- Added `DeleteAllSessionsByUserID` method to user repository
- Added `Logout` method to user service interface
- Frontend `AuthContext` now calls backend logout before clearing local storage
- Migration automatically cleans up incompatible authentication artifacts

### Testing

- New integration tests for logout functionality (`tests/integration/user_logout_test.go`)
- New integration tests for rate limiter (`tests/integration/rate_limiter_test.go`)
- Unit tests for rate limiter with race detection
- Fixed race condition in concurrent rate limiter test (atomic operations)
- All tests pass with `-race` flag enabled

### Documentation

- Updated security audit document (`SECURITY_AUDIT_JWT_SESSIONS.md`)
- Changed "No Server-Side Logout" from 🔴 CRITICAL to ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Changed "Brute Force Risk" from MEDIUM to LOW
- Added detailed implementation notes and testing coverage
- Comprehensive migration guide in v15 migration file

### Post-Migration Actions Required

1. **Users**: Log in again with email/password (or magic code)
2. **API Key Holders**: Regenerate API keys in Settings → API Keys
3. **Integrations**: Update all API integrations with new keys
4. **Workspace Admins**: Resend pending invitations via Settings → Members → Invitations

### Migration Notes

- Migration v15 is idempotent and safe to run multiple times
- Estimated migration time: < 1 second
- Server automatically restarts after migration
- Migration validates `SECRET_KEY` environment variable before proceeding
- Comprehensive migration summary displayed in console

## [14.1] - 2025-11-01

### Features

- **Bulk Contact Import**: New `/api/contacts.import` endpoint for efficiently importing large numbers of contacts
  - Creates or updates multiple contacts in a single batch operation using PostgreSQL bulk upsert
  - Returns individual operation results (created/updated/error) for each contact
  - Optional bulk subscription to lists via `subscribe_to_lists` parameter
  - Significantly faster than individual upsert operations for large imports
  - Batch size of 100 contacts processed at a time in the UI
  - Supports partial success - some contacts can succeed while others fail validation

## [14.0] - 2025-10-31

### Database Schema Changes

- Added `channel_options` JSONB column to `message_history` table to store email/SMS/push delivery options (CC, BCC, FromName, ReplyTo...)

### Features

- **Internal Task Scheduler**: Tasks now execute automatically every 30 seconds
  - No external cron job required
  - Configurable via `TASK_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `TASK_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL`, `TASK_SCHEDULER_MAX_TASKS`
  - Starts automatically with the app, stops gracefully on shutdown
  - Faster task processing (30s vs 60s minimum with external cron)
- **Privacy Settings**: New optional configuration for telemetry and update checks
  - `TELEMETRY` environment variable (optional) - Send anonymous usage statistics
  - `CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment variable (optional) - Check for new versions
  - Both can be configured via setup wizard if not set as environment variables
  - For existing installations: migration v14 sets both to `true` by default (respects env vars if set)
  - Environment variables always take precedence over database settings
- Message history now stores email delivery options:
  - CC (carbon copy recipients)
  - BCC (blind carbon copy recipients)
  - FromName (sender display name override)
  - ReplyTo (reply-to address override)
- Message preview drawer displays email delivery options when present
- Only stores email options in this version (SMS/push to be added later)
- Modernized Docker Compose to use current standards: renamed `docker-compose.yml` to `compose.yaml`, removed deprecated `version` field, updated commands to use `docker compose` plugin syntax, and improved `.env` file integration

### UI Changes

- Removed cron setup instructions from setup wizard
- Removed cron status warning banner from workspace layout
- Simpler onboarding experience - no manual cron configuration needed
- Added preview mode to notification center
- **Setup Wizard Improvements**:
  - Added newsletter subscription option
  - PASETO keys configuration moved to collapsible "Advanced Settings" section
  - Added "Privacy Settings" section for telemetry and update check configuration
  - Improved restart handling: displays setup completion screen immediately while server restarts
  - User can review generated keys before manually redirecting to signin

### Deprecated (kept for backward compatibility)

- `/api/cron` HTTP endpoint (internal scheduler is now primary)
- `/api/cron.status` HTTP endpoint (still functional but not advertised)

### Fixes

- Fix: SMTP now supports unauthenticated/anonymous connections (e.g., local mail relays on port 25)
- Fix: Docker images now built with CGO disabled to prevent SIGILL crashes on older CPUs
- Fix: Decode HTML entities in URL attributes to ensure links with query parameters work correctly in MJML-compiled emails
- Fix: Normalize browser timezone names to canonical IANA format to prevent timezone mismatch errors
- Fix: Broadcast pause also pauses the associated task

### Migration Notes

- Added `ShouldRestartServer()` method to migration interface
- Migrations can now trigger automatic server restart when config reload is needed
- Existing messages will have `channel_options = NULL` (no backfill)
- Migration v14 adds default telemetry and update check settings for existing installations (both default to `true`)
- Migration is idempotent and safe to run multiple times
- Estimated migration time: < 1 second per workspace
- Server will automatically restart after migration to reload all configuration settings
